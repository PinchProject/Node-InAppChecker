## Fake Purchases That Pass Validation

From [Hussain Fakhruddin's blog](http://blog.hussulinux.com/2013/04/apple-ios-in-app-purchase-hacking-how-to-prevent-specially-com-zeptolab-ctrbonus-superpower1-hacks/comment-page-1/#comment-33261):

Many jailbroken iOS devices just change the outgoing purchase receipt to an existing valid purchase receipt. (There are background apps to do this). Our server will then send this to Apple server for verification and guess what, apple will send a confirmation! A sheer good trick. But weâ€™re smarter. Check if the product id is one of your products or not. If not, just cancel it out. The most famous spoofed product id is **com.zeptolab.ctrbonus.superpower1**.  If you encounter any product ID apart from your own, then simply block them. They are not genuine at all!
